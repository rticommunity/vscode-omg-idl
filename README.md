# OMG IDL Syntax Highlighter

The [OMG Interface Definition Language (IDL)](https://www.omg.org/spec/IDL)
(ISO/IEC 19516:2020) is a descriptive language used to define data types and
interfaces in a way that is independent of the programming language, operating
system, and processor platform.

This extension adds syntax highlighting for a subset of the OMG IDL syntax,
including most of the rules from the following building blocks:

* Core Data Types
* Value Types
* Modules
* Annotations
